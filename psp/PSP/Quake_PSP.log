  Your group is currently "mkpasswd".  This indicates that
  the /etc/passwd (and possibly /etc/group) files should be rebuilt.
  See the man pages for mkpasswd and mkgroup then, for example, run
  mkpasswd -l [-d] > /etc/passwd
  mkgroup  -l [-d] > /etc/group
  Note that the -d switch is necessary for domain users.
  make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.
